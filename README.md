# Viddist

A completely decentralized video streaming and publishing app

## Installation

1. `git clone` Viddist, or download the project as a zip and unpack.
2. `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
3. Import the `dist` dir/folder into [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/) and open it there.

## Contributing

* Run standard.js and ESLint on the code before committing js. package.json has
an eslint config provided. There are good plugins for most editors that
automatically run these tools for you.
* Feel free to ask questions by opening issues or writing to me on irc
(Powersource on freenode) or twitter ([@the_lolness](https://twitter.com/The_lolness)).
* PRs welcome, but if you want to try something bigger please talk to me first
so we're on the same page :)

## Non-goals

#### Supporting other media types.

A music player/image viewer would require drastically different ui/ux. Videos are relatively bulky but simple and don't require as many features as e.g. music players do.

#### Breaking the law.

The repositories/documentation will never contain (directly, or indirectly through links) content that isnâ€™t freely distributable in the west, and the developers don't condone using this software to break copyright law. *Can't we just share funny cat videos (of our own cats) and get along?*
