# Viddist
A completely decentralized video streaming and publishing app

## Installation
1. `git clone` Viddist, or download the project as a zip and unpack.
2. `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## Usage notes
* You can find free videos to try the app on in [test-videos.md](./test-videos.md)
* It's lacking a lot of needed ui so far, so open the console by pressing
`ctrl+shift+i` to see status messages
* Publishing and reading profiles takes super long (a minute or two). Wait for
the console to say that the profile is published before trying to read it.

## Contributing
* Run standard.js and ESLint on the code before committing js. package.json has
an eslint config provided. There are good plugins for (at least) vscode that
automatically run these tools for you.
* Feel free to ask questions by opening issues or writing to me on irc
(Powersource on freenode) or twitter (@the_lolness).
* PRs welcome, but if you want to try something bigger please talk to me first
so we're on the same page :)
