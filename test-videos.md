# Testing videos

These are videos hosted on ipfs that you can use for testing

These are from the CCC archives, pinned by others but recommended to pin locally to
speed up testing. (I don't recommend pinning the top hash, it is several TBs
large)
* "Blinkenlights 1"
 `QmW84mqTYnCkRTy6VeRJebPWuuk8b27PJ4bWm2bL4nrEWb/blinkenlights/mp4/blinkenlights-video-large.mp4`
* "Blinkenlights 2"
`QmW84mqTYnCkRTy6VeRJebPWuuk8b27PJ4bWm2bL4nrEWb/blinkenlights/mp4/P-Link.mp4`

The videos below are things that are probably offline. Contact
me and I'll bring up my daemon for a bit so you can pin them.
